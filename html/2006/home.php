	 <p>open, honest, a bit eccentric, fit, smart, witty. Self-taught photographer, 
	 and student at Icelands academy of the arts, visual arts department.</p>
	 <p>I have a constant need to illustrate how i see the world. 
	 My camera is my paintbrush and canvas. To hear that my work brings joy 
	 to others makes me feel quite blessed. What more can an artist hope for? :)
All photos here taken by me and processed by me, unless otherwise noted.</p>

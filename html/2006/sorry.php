		<p>Hi all,</p>
		<p>Some people are causing <strong>trouble to the servers</strong>. I am doing everything I can to restore Rebekka's blog ASAP.</p>
		<p>You mostly some for the photos, so I took care of that already and just so you know I am <strong>prioritizing</strong> the restoration of <strong>her blog over my own</strong>.</p>
		<p>Thank you for your patience,</p>
		<p>
